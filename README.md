# Cymatic stomatal stimulation — independent evaluation

Reproducible evaluation of M. Mazgal, *Cymatic Stomatal Stimulation and Pulsed
Optical Assimilation: Scaling from Cybernetic Bioreactors to Industrial-Scale
Acoustic Modulation* (Zenodo, 5 October 2026, DOI
[10.5281/zenodo.23156927](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23156927)).

The write-up is in [`PAPER.md`](PAPER.md), in Czech in [`PAPER.cs.md`](PAPER.cs.md).

**Both frequencies the design rests on are the note B.** 246.91 Hz is equal-tempered
B3 to within 0.22 cents, 61.72 Hz is B1 to within 0.43 cents, and the optical period
50 µs + 4000 µs is 4.050 ms = 246.91 Hz — so the timing derived from Calvin-cycle
kinetics and the frequency derived from guard-cell mechanics are one number. At
1.2346 % duty the average irradiance is 256 µmol/m²/s, below light saturation for
every C3 crop, so the quenching the design bypasses is barely engaged in the regime
it creates; and dry matter per kilowatt-hour is invariant under pulsing to
3.6·10⁻¹⁵, which is the quantity §5 claims to redefine. At field scale a
three-bladed turbine's blade-pass frequency is 0.700 Hz where 61.72 Hz is wanted,
its whole broadband output is 22.5 dB short of the level the cited review works at,
and a 50 Hz transformer core has no 61.72 Hz line to tune.

This is the first of the author's eleven deposits with no hypercomplex algebra in
it and the first with an almost entirely real bibliography; §1 of the write-up sets
out what is correct before anything else.

## Requirements

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # numpy only
```

No GPU, no network. Everything is arithmetic on the preprint's own parameters and
on published constants, because the deposit ships no code, no measurements and no
figures.

## Reproducing the results

```
./run_all.sh          # everything, about 2 seconds on any CPU
```

| Script | What it computes | Section |
|---|---|---|
| `frequency.py` | nearest equal-tempered pitch to each published frequency; the optical period against the acoustic one; the cited band against the derived subharmonic | §§2–3 |
| `light.py` | duty cycle and time-averaged photon flux against C3 light saturation; the dark interval against RuBisCO and the PQ pool; invariance of g/kWh | §§4–6 |
| `acoustics.py` | blade-pass frequency, the rotor speed and tip Mach the target needs, the sound-power budget at 100–1000 m, wind-farm spacing as a phased array, transformer harmonics | §§7–8 |
| `water.py` | transpiration across the midday depression, and water per unit carbon | §9 |

Every external constant is in [`constants.py`](constants.py) with its source, and
no script defines a physical constant of its own. Full output of one run:
[`results.log`](results.log).

## Key numbers

| what | published | measured / computed |
|---|---|---|
| 246.91 Hz, "synthesized to maximize localized guard cell vibration" | — | **B3**, −0.22 cents |
| 61.72 Hz, "calculated" subharmonic | — | **B1**, −0.43 cents |
| optical period 50 µs + 4000 µs | from "the Calvin cycle" | **246.91 Hz** — the same number as the acoustic one, to 1.5·10⁻⁵ |
| PAFT sensitive band | "typically between 50 and 120 Hz" | cited review gives **0.1–1 kHz**; the division by 4 leaves it |
| time-averaged irradiance | "extreme-intensity photon bursts (4500 W/m²)" | **55.6 W/m² = 256 µmol/m²/s**, 0.13× full sun |
| that average against C3 light saturation | bypasses NPQ | **1.57× below** lettuce, 5.48× below wheat |
| ceiling on bypassing NPQ | "up to 60%" dissipated | **2.50×**, from the paper's own figure |
| dark phase vs the mechanism named | "perfectly matches … the Calvin cycle" | Calvin **250–500 ms**, 62–125× off; PQ pool **2–20 ms** |
| g/kWh over an 81-fold range of duty cycle | "redefine the gram-per-watt limit of CEA" | spread **3.6·10⁻¹⁵** — invariant |
| g/kWh, assumptions favouring the design | redefined | **12.42**, inside the commercial 5–10 range |
| blade-pass frequency, 3 blades at 14 rpm | retunable to 61.72 Hz | **0.700 Hz** — 61.72 Hz is the 88th harmonic |
| rotor speed for a 61.72 Hz blade pass | reached by "electromagnetically braking" | **1234 rpm**, Mach **18.8** at the tip, **85 167 g** |
| turbine sound power vs 70 dB at the plant | "large-scale agricultural acoustic stimulators" | short **22.5 dB (179×)** at 300 m, **33.0 dB (1987×)** at 1 km |
| the loss the frequency choice addresses | "minimal atmospheric attenuation" | correct, and it is **0.1 dB** against **24 dB** of spreading |
| wind farm as a phased array | "phased acoustic arrays" | elements **90–180 λ** apart where λ/2 is needed; 0.136° of rotor angle |
| transformer lines available on a 50 Hz grid | "tuned to precisely 61.72 Hz" | integer multiples of **50 Hz**; nearest is 11.72 Hz away |
| "asymmetric DC injection" | a tuning control | half-cycle saturation — the geomagnetic-current damage mode |
| midday transpiration if stomata are held open | "evapotranspiration rates will rise" | **3.0×**, independent of VPD |
| water per unit carbon | — | **1.3–2.5×** for every saturating assimilation response |
| 15–18 % biomass increase | claimed | asserted, with no link to dose, duration, frequency or crop |
| references | 5 given | **4 of 5** resolve exactly; the 5th could not be located (§10) |

## Scope

The deposit is a four-page preprint under CC BY 4.0 with no accompanying code, no
measurements and no figures, so there is no implementation to test; §6 of it says
hardware topology, STM32 firmware and CAD models "will be maintained in an
open-source GitHub repository", and names none. The limits of what is computed here
are set out in §11 of the write-up — no plants were grown, and the acoustic model is
hemispherical spreading, calibrated against the 40–45 dB(A) measured at 300 m.
